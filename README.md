# spotifyGroupQueue

The purpose of this project is to simulate a group queue in Spotify. The specific use case that I have built this app for is when you are in a group setting and one person is connected to a speaker and controlling the song queue.

With this web app it is possible to host a room (using your Spotify account) that your friends can then join and queue songs of their choosing.

While this project is an active work in progress, it is in a functional and semi stable state. I will be continuing to improve the code base as well as add new features.

## Todo
- Improve code coverage through tests
- Convert in memory storage to some sort of database (thinking PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Add more documentation to improve readability
- Refine code base since this was largely a prototype
